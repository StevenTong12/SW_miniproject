            <h3>Who does COVID-19 affect?</h3> 

            <p> 
                It is apparent that many people who die from COVID-19 are 
                majority elderly people or people with pre-existing conditions. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                HOWEVER, that does not mean that COVID-19 will not affect those 
                who are young and do not have pre-existing conditions! 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                There are so many young people who were healty and had no 
                pre-existing conditions that suffered greatly from 
                permanent lung damage and sometimes even sense of smell or 
                taste. Do you really want to go through that? 
                <br>

            <p> 
                1. Quarantine yourself! If you live with others, make sure you find a 
                room away from others to quarantine yourself. The CDC recommends 
                that people who do show symptoms or test positive should quarantine for 
                2 weeks. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                2. If your symptoms are severe please have someone call 9-11 immediately! 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                3. DO NOT INTERACT with ANYONE! Even if you are asymptomatic or have mild 
                symptoms it does not mean that other people's body will react the same way!
