The purpose of this project is to build an app or website that is able to keep track of the COVID-19 symptoms that individuals are having. On top of that, it should allow admins 
access to statistics/graphs demonstrating the data collected from each individual. 

We chose to build a website for this project that uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Firebase.
