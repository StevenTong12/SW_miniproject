The purpose of this project is to build an app or website that is able to keep track of the COVID-19 symptoms that individuals are having. On top of that, it should allow admins 
access to statistics/graphs demonstrating the data collected from each individual. 

We chose to build a website for this project that uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Firebase and Python. 

Our system provides the chance for users to login and fill out a daily symptoms form to allow institutions/companies to keep track of the symptoms that their students or employees have. There will be an admin account that will have access to all the data/statistics of the overall symptoms recorded, allowing Deans of institutions and executives of companies to keep track of the health of their students/employees.
