# SW_miniproject 

#Jaden Tayag and Steven Tong 
#The purpose of this project is to design a COVID-19 Tracker allowing people to keep track of the symptoms that their users are experiencing. We could chose to approach this project through building a website that allows SSO authentication. 

In this repo, we uploaded all the photos and files that we used to create our website. Within our website, we offer SSO authentication for both admin and users. Both accounts will have access to filling out the symptoms form and submitting it for record. On top of that, we offer 3 other pages/tabs, one that offers tips on preventing the spread of COVID-19, another that provides information of what to do if a person tests positive or is experiencing symptoms and lastly, a dashboard showing statistics on COVID-19. The dashboard will be different for admin accounts and user accounts. The admin will have the option to see how many people within their community experience particular symptoms as well as statistics/numbers in Massachusetts and the United States. The users are more limited when viewing the dashboard, they will only see the statistics/numbers in Massachusetts and the United States. 

These are some of the programming languages and resources we used: 

- HTML 
- CSS 
- JavaScript 
- Python 
- Firebase 
- Flask
